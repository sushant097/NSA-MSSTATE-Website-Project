## 🔔 NSA Alert Popup Feature (Smart Announcements)

A dynamic popup shows special NSA alerts using Google Sheets + Apps Script backend.

### 🧹 How It Works
- A Google Sheet stores the current announcement, link, type (`info`, `warning`, `urgent`), and expiry date.
- A deployed Apps Script Web App reads this data and returns a JSON response.
- On `index.html`, a fetch request on page load pulls this data and displays a styled popup based on alert `type`.

### 🎨 Type-Based Styling
| Type | Visual | Style |
|------|--------|-------|
| `info` | ℹ️ | Teal border + light blue background |
| `warning` | ⚠️ | Yellow border + light yellow background |
| `urgent` | ❗ | Red border + light red background |

### 🛠️ To Edit or Add an Alert
1. Open the Google Sheet configured in the script
2. Update row 2 with:
   - `enabled = TRUE`
   - `valid_till = MM-DD-YYYY` (as string)
   - `message`, `type`, and optional `link`
3. Save — the change will automatically reflect on the website

### 🔐 Security Note
- The Google Sheet **does NOT need to be public**.
- The Apps Script runs as the owner's account and can access the sheet privately.
- Only the deployed script URL is public and returns read-only JSON.

## 🔧 What to Edit

### ✅ Navbar and Footer
- **header.html** and **footer.html** are loaded on all pages using jQuery:
  ```js
  $("#header-placeholder").load("header.html");
  $("#footer-placeholder").load("footer.html");
  ```
- ✏️ To update site-wide navigation or footer links, edit these two files.

### ✅ Homepage (`index.html`)
- ✨ Uses `Typed.js`, `AOS`, and CSS animations.
- Team members section is designed to be **dynamically generated** from a JSON file (planned enhancement).
- Carousel at the top rotates images from `/img/` folder.
- NSA announcement popup is loaded on page load.

#### Change Team Members:
1. Update JSON file: `data/team-members-details.json` (to be created).
2. Update team member images in `img/team-images/`.
3. JavaScript will read and inject new entries dynamically (make sure the script is present).

### ✅ Alumni Page (`alumni.html`)
- Loads data from: `data/alumni_data.json`
- Features:
  - Paginated results
  - Real-time search bar
  - Uses Bootstrap styling

#### Add or Edit Alumni:
- Update `alumni_data.json` with:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Full Name",
    "department": "Dept. of X",
    "batch": "2021",
    "organization": "Current Workplace",
    "contact": "https://linkedin.com/in/example",
    "contactType": "LinkedIn"
  }
  ```

### ✅ More Info Page (`more-info.html`)
- Helpful for newly admitted students
- Includes:
  - Travel info with airport options
  - Popular apartments near MSU
  - Community group invitation

### ✅ Connect Page (`connect.html`)
- Background image carousel + blurred overlay
- Includes:
  - Cowbell Connect button
  - Social media icons
  - Embedded Google Form

## 👨‍💻 Developer Tips

- All dynamic content is added inside:

  <div class="team-scroll" id="team-container"></div>
  ```
- Use `data-aos` and `animate__` classes to add entry animations.
- All carousel images are stored in `/img/` and updated via:
  ```html
  <div class="carousel-item"><img src="img/dashain-2023.jpg" ... /></div>
  ```
